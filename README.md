# CIS4930_EC
Extra credit CIS4930 assignment for Fall 2024.

To run my code, I would recommend using Python 3.13. You can download it off of the Microsoft Store, or from the official Python website. I tested running it on Python 2 using https://onecompiler.com/python2 and it compiled in case your system has Python 2 instead.
To compile my code with Python 3.13, execute this command (without the quotes) in Command Prompt, inside of the directory where the code resides: 
  'python3.13 cis4930_ec.py'
If you do not have Python 3.13, consult the official Python documentation for your specific version to obtain instructions on how to run my code.

To modify this assignment to incorporate it into the course as an "official" assignment, I would recommend adding more functions for students to write (such as a delete function). This would add a modest amount of difficulty to the assignment and challenge students to think, as well as provide some nice programming practice. Furthermore, if the course staff really wanted to step-up the difficulty of this assignment, they could incorporate some form of socket programming to facilitate transactions between two machines on a network. This would be considerably more difficult, but it could be a fun challenge.
